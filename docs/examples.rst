Example 1 - Simple Peak
-----------------------

This example sets up the connection using CAN with the Peak-USB Interface. This is using an E400 with the standard Embed bootloader which supports ISO-14229 UDS. The serial number of the ECU is an ASCII encoded string, in this case "0000000000000001".

::

    from uds import Uds

    E400 = Uds(resId=0x600, reqId=0x650, transportProtocol="CAN", interface="peak", device="PCAN_USBBUS1")
    try:
        response = E400.send([0x22, 0xF1, 0x8C]) # gets the entire response from the ECU
    except:
        print("Send did not complete")
    if(serialNumberArary[0] = 0x7F):
        print("Negative response")
    else:
        serialNumberArray = response[3:] # cuts the response down to just the serial number
        serialNumberString = "" # initialises the string
        for i in serialNumberArray: serialNumberString += chr(i) # Iterates over each element and converts the array element into an ASCII string
        print(serialNumberString) # prints the ASCII string

As the send function can produce exceptions this needs to be checked before continuing. After this it needs to check for a negative response and then can begin decoding the response.

Example 2 - Simple Vector
----------------

This example sets up the connection using CAN with the Vector Interface. This is similar to example 1 so it only includes the initialisation.

It assumes that the Vector hardware has been set up with the application name "pythonUds", this bypasses the licencing for a particular software suite (CANalyser, CANoe. etc)

::

    E400 = Uds(resId=0x600, reqId=0x650, transportProtocol="can", interface="vector", appName="pythonUds", channel=0)

Once this is initialised then the communication with the ECU is the same as Example 1

Example 3 - Simple LIN using Peak-USB Pro
-----------------------------------------

This example sets up a connection over LIN

::

    LightModule = Uds(nodeAddress=0x10, transportProtocol="LIN")

Once this is initialised then the communication with the ECU is the same as Example 1

Example 4 - Using the ODX Parser
--------------------------------

CAN using Peak Interface with Bootloader Example ODX file.

::

    bootloader = createUdsConnection("Bootloader.odx", "", reqId=0x600, resId=0x650, interface="peak")
    serialNumber = bootloader.readDataByIdentifier("ECU Serial Number")
    print(serialNumber)
    bootloader.writeDataByIdentifier("Engine Speed Cutoff", 5000)
    
This example uses the readDataByIdentifier and writeDataByIdentifier to get the Serial Number and set the Engine Speed Cutoff parameter used by the model. The string used to identify the instance of the service is defined in the ODX file as a human readable value to ease interfacing with the module.

The returned values are encoded into their physical datatype defined in the ODX file rather than the user having to know the encoding format.

Example 5 - Simple DOIP Using Media Converter
----------------------------------------------

::

    from uds import Uds

    ecu = Uds(transportProtocol="DoIP", ecu_ip="192.168.1.1", ecu_logical_address=1)
    try:
        response = ecu.send([0x3E, 0x00])
        print(TesterPresent)  # This should be [0x7E, 0x00]
    except:
        print("Send did not complete")


Programming Sequence 1
----------------------

This sequence is part of the standard programming sequence for an ECU over CAN. It includes a dummy seed-key exchange.

The file E400NewProgrammingSequence_ defines the programming sequence based on the Bootloader.odx_ file
